<div id="menu" class="section active">
    <h2>Menu</h2>
    <p>
        The menu plays a recording. It lets the caller make a selection.
        The system waits for the maximum number of digits used in actions of the current menu.
        Hunt Functionality: Works that when nothing was selected it will always go back to the previous menu.
        If there was no input after repeating 3 times (and hunt is not defined) It will go back 1 level.
        If already at the top level, it would end the call (to handle callers falling asleep while listening).
        Default * Key Behavior:key goes back to the previous menu unless there is an action that has a * key in the current menu.
        (Menu must have an IVR file recording to work)
