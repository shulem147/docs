<div id="admin" class="section active">
    <h2>Admin</h2>
    <p>
        Admin is where you manage the system.
        The phone admin button is used to manage various settings through the phone. A PIN number is required and will not work if there is no pin set (if you absolutely need to use without a pin use the bypass option for the pin, highly not recommended).

        Under Destination, there are several options: 
        Leave empty; this will prompt the caller to enter the IVR ID number of the key they want to manage anywhere in the system.
        If the destination contains an IVR ID then the system will not prompt for an IVR ID but will rather just apply to the specified IVR ID.
        If the destination contains the word mini it will only allow managing the top level menu based on the key instead of IVR ID (only edit single-digit numbers).
        If the destination contains the word folder it will only allow managing the current menu based on the key instead of IVR ID. folder2 is the same as folder but allows 2 digit actions.
        If the destination contains the word stats it will allow you to Listen to Call Reports.

        Voicemail Admin Messages or Record Bulletin Admin Messages:
        limited => true 
        if used in an admin of a voicemail will only give the option of listening to voicemail, when used for a bulletin will only give the option of recording bulletin messages.
