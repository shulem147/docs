<div id="bulletin" class="section active">
    <h2>Bulletin</h2>
    <p>
        Update messages. Callers always hear the latest message. Bulletin Files contain the recordings. Date and time entries determine the order of playback. You can move the recordings by changing the dates. For example, day camps use it for trip updates. No IVR file is required to work, but if you upload a recording, it will play before the bulletin messages (e.g., a message could say, "You can always press the # key to access previous messages")
