        The system consists of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) Menu, where each menu can consist of many options selectable by assigned DTMF keys, a menu can contain several types of actions (menu, playback etc.) each of these actions has an IVR ID which is what we refer to in this manual.
        Each action (with the exception of the top/root menu) also has a PARENT ID which is the IVR ID of the menu where the current action resides.
        Each action (except for the main menu) has a KEY which is which DTMF key or keys need to be dialed to get this action
