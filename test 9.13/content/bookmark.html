<div id="bookmark" class="section active">
    <h2>Bookmark</h2>
    <p>
        By default, 0 creates a bookmark. This action provides an option to return to the bookmark (e.g., press # to return to the bookmark). You can create more than one return-to-bookmark option but will still only save one bookmark.
        There's also an option for Automatic bookmark: Every time a person hangs up, that's where the bookmark is set. It's under advanced settings - Auto Bookmark. Also, ensure it's set by Destination - Auto.
