    <h2>File Types</h2>
    <p>
        The system uses .wav files 8000hz (8khz), Mono (Single Channel), 16bit PCM (Uncompressed). 
        The system would still accept most standard formats of Audio and will attempt to convert the file to the correct format, we cannot guarantee the quality of the conversion.
