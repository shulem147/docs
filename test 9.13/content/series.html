    <h2>Series</h2>
    <pre>
        Instead of having a menu with many playbacks, use Series. Upload the recordings and number them. Create a main recording that provides callers with all the options. Upload this recording under IVR Files. There's also an option to have an automated announcement like "You can choose between 1 and 200..." (Options > autoMenu > true). This is where the default language comes in; if it's Yiddish, the announcement will be in Yiddish.


        A series is a collection of files that are simply numbered and can also be used in different modes:
        Select (default if not specified)
        Rotate
        Rollback
        Random
        עמוד יומי


        You can set the method to any of the following: 
        method=>select
        method=>rotate
        method=>rollback
        method=>random

        To set the DTMF profile to use while playing files in the series.
        flexProfile=>bulletin
        With roll back method, (default) it will play starting from smallest and this is going to change the files to be played latest first (like a bulletin)
